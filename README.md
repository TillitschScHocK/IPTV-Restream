## 📖 About

**IPTV Spaten** is a lightweight application for:

- 🎬 **IPTV Restreaming** – re-routing streams for better compatibility  
- 👥 **Synchronization (Watch2Gether)** – enjoy IPTV with friends in real time  
- 🌐 **Web Frontend** – easy-to-use browser interface  

Currently, this is an **early-stage version** mainly built for the **German user base**.  
However, the documentation is in **English** to make it easy for international contributors to join.

## ⚙️ Settings

### Channel Mode

You can choose between **three playback modes** depending on your needs:

#### 🔹 `Direct`

* Uses the source stream directly
* ⚠️ Not reliable due to **CORS**, **IP/device restrictions**, and lack of support for custom headers
* Not recommended except for testing

#### 🔹 `Proxy` (**Preferred**)

* Streams are proxied through the backend
* ✅ Works with custom headers and bypasses CORS issues
* Best choice for most users

#### 🔹 `Restream`

* The backend **caches and restreams** the source with **FFmpeg**
* Useful for provider restrictions or sync issues
* ⏳ May cause slightly longer load times
